# SQL-PowerBI-Projects

This repository contains multiple data analysis projects focused on different domains using SQL and Power BI.

Airbnb NYC Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)

**Description**:  
In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Airbnb NYC dataset using SQL. I explored the data, extracted key insights using SQL, and then imported the dataset into Power BI for visualization. The visualizations are based on the insights gained from SQL exploration.

Airbnb Power BI Dashboard

**Description**:  
The dashboard highlights key metrics such as host activity, price trends, and neighborhood-wise performance, based on the insights extracted during the SQL exploration.

Pizza Sales Analysis (Power BI)

**Description**:  
This project focuses on sales analysis for a pizza shop. Using Power BI's data transformation tools, the dataset was cleaned and prepared. DAX queries were used for dynamic calculations, and the dashboard offers interactive, real-time insights into pizza sales performance.
